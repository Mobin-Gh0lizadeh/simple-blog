# Simple Blog
We have proposed a simple blog project in which categories can be added to posts with the possibility of filtering them. Users who are registered can also like posts or add comments too. They can use the register or login options and even request to retrieval the password accordingly.
In FrontEnd, this bootstrap is used in its simplest word mainly for beginner users.
